# rainbowimp

Connect an addressable LED strip to an Electric imp, and voil√°, you can haz a light show.

Deploy the Squirrel code to your imp and see what you can do. An example html form shows how to send data from a web page is provided and you can test it [right here](http://ejeklint.github.com/rainbowimp/).

A little more info is available on [my blog](http://ejeklint.se/fancy-leds-with-electric-imp/).
